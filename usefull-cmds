>>> the diff between df -h , du -h 

- The du command is very useful to track down disk space hogs. It is useful to find out the names of directories and files that consume large amounts of space on a disk. The basic syntax is:
du
du /path/do/dir
- df -h    : for the disk          which du : for specific directory

>>> what is the diff between the grep and awk
- grep: search for specific terms in a file
#usage
$ grep This file.txt

awk is mostly used for data extraction and reporting
